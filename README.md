## Description
YOLO, a powerful object detection algorithm, is revolutionizing agriculture by enabling 
the swift and accurate classification of various vegetables within images. By leveraging 
deep learning techniques, YOLO can efficiently identify and categorize different types of 
vegetables, such as capsicum, carrots, and cauliflower, with remarkable precision. 
This technology holds the potential to streamline crop monitoring, yield estimation, 
and quality control processes, ultimately enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.
